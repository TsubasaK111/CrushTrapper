## Models Included:

 - **User**
    - Stores unique user_name.
    
 - **Game**
    - Stores unique game states. Associated with User model via KeyProperty.
    
 - **Score**
    - Records completed games. Associated with Users model via KeyProperty.
    
## Additional Endpoints Required:

 - **get_user_games**
    - Sometimes the urlsafe Key strings for games could be lost or garbled by client
    software. Create an endpoint that returns all of a User's current games.
    
 - **get_high_scores**
    - Right now the **get_scores** endpoint returns all scores. Create a new endpoint
    that returns only 'winning' scores, with better scores coming first. Accept
    and optional parameter `number_of_results` that limits the number of results
    returned.
    
 - **get_user_ranking**
    - Come up with a method for ranking the performance of each player. For
    "Guess a Number" this could be the ratio of won/lost games (watch out for 
    division by zero!) with ties broken by the average number of guesses.
    - Create an endpoint that returns this player ranking. The results should 
    include each Player's name and the 'performance' indicator (eg. win/loss
    ratio).
